### Description

This is a Switcher Client (World Switcher, like SwiftSwitch) for Runescape. It is the first of its kind on this site, and has a few cool features like Sending login details to RS, sending an instant message to RS, taking screenshots, setting a default world for loading on startup, transparency (yay I did it! simple too, but may not work on slow computers I doubt it, CODE NOT BY ME!), remove adds for free servers, snippets, check for updates, custom buttons, and a few more less useful options too!
